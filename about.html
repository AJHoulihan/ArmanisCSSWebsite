    <p class="chartreuse">I like playing guitar and learning about music,
         I listen to music very often so I figured I should learn how to play!
        <br>I wasn't very good at first, I found it hard to accurately move my fingers around the strings.
        <br>Eventually I built up the dexterity to be able to play faster and it felt good to see that progress.
        <br>I want to start a band soon to put my efforts to the test.
